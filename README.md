#### ABSTRACT:
This is a paired project from Mod 3 at Turing School of Software and Design. We were given a spec detailing a travel app that can be used by logging in with a name, email, and travel type. On login, the app reroutes to a user dashboard that greets the user by name and displays the areas available for booking. If the user clicks on an area, they are redirected to a page that fetches the listings from an API and displays them all with an image. If an individual listing is clicked on, the user is routed to a page displaying more information about that listing. The user can add and remove listings from their favorites, which they can view by selecting the favorites button in the header,

A main learning goal of this project was learning React, including testing with Jest, asynchronous functions/testing, and data handling. 

#### SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

* Clone this repo
* Clone the backend API repo [https://github.com/MandyAlford/VRAD]
* From your terminal, open each of the above repos.
* Enter <npm start> in your command line for each repo.
* The App should load in your browser.  
  

#### WIREFRAME:
We are updating our wireframe as we work, so visiting [our wireframe on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/RArYIkKpWCdANKnyw6LiXn/VRAD-Wireframe?node-id=9%3A13) is the best way to see the most up-to-date version. The screenshots below represent the ultimate goal for our app. Certain pages, like the listings page, don't currently match the wireframe. We wanted the wireframe to represent the best UI/UX possible. As our skills improve, we will continue to update the app in an effort to reach this goal.

#### NEXT STEPS:
1. Adding slideshow galleries on listing cards
2. Adding icons and styling information display on listing cards
3. Adding an interactive map feature to view listings in an area
4. Using localStorage to save favorites for a user
5. Adding a notification for a listing being added or removed from favorites and button styling to match
